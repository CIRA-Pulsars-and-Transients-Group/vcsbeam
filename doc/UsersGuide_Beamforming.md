## Beamforming pipeline

To beamform an MWA observation, you will need both the MWA data of the target observation, and an MWA calibration solution that is was taken around the same time period as the target observation.
This page describes (see [Calibration](@ref usersguidecalibration) for how to prepare a calibration solution).
